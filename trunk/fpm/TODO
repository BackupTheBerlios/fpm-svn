- Regression tests.
- Removal of conditional statement in sqrt macros (in converge); find a way
  to change them into 0 or 1 and use multiplication. This should be a huge
  speed up for the algorithmic versions.
- Add more functions like (arc)sin, (arc)cos, (arc)tan, et cetera.
- Inivestigate possibilities to increase speed with SIMD instructions. (might
  be difficult because a lot of algorithms use 64 bits at times. SSE2 maybe? )
- Write sample code. Preferably something that does something useful :)
- Document __FPM_VERSION_RELEASE__  valid values are: alpha, beta, stable and
  cvs.
- Add selective LUT support, like only include luts for a specific f.p type
