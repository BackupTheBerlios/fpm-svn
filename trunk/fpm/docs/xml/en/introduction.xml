            This is a macro library written in the C programming language,
            and implements fixed point arithmetic. Although current
            state-of-the-art FPU's are getting faster and faster, it might
            still be beneficial to implement your algorithms with fixed point
            arithmetic to gain even higher speeds, although at the cost of
            precission. Fixed point arithmetic is less precise than floating
            point arithmetic, but lots of times, the extra precission is
            not needed.

        <para>
            I chose to implement this library as a set of macro's instead of
            functions, to avoid having the extra overhead of function calls.
            This might add a little to the codesize of the program that
            utilizes this library, but assures you that no precious clockcycles
            are wasted by saving and restoring CPU registers.
