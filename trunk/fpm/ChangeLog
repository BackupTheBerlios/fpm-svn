v0.30   [First alpha release]

    - Better Makefile(s)
    - Fixed exp macro's conditional expressions to always evaluate as true
    - Added make install/uninstall
    - Generation of index.html for graphs
    - Barcharts index.html "tool"
    - Updated documentation

v0.29   Added lut support for ln, exp and pow (indirectly)
v0.28   Added precision(lut) and script to generate graphs of the output
v0.27   First draft of documentation
v0.26   Setup documentation build system
v0.25   Moved types to code.h, finished sqrt LUT support (maybe 8fp24 needs
        one more table, or at least higher resolution for lut256)
v0.24   All todo's for 0.23 done.
v0.23   Decent non-autotools configure script added; todo: test for gnuplot,
        awk and fig2dev and have genbarchart act on that if one of them isn't
        found. also add --with-indent= etc. options
v0.22   Benchmark output changed to values and comments only, wrote barchart
        script to generate PNG files of benchmark output, adjusted makefile
        to do that
v0.21   Preliminary sqrt LUT support and split of code and API in two .h
        files.
v0.20   Added pow()
v0.19   After doing some timing tests, the "oh-so-clever" sqrt algorithm
        turned out to be 10-15 times slower than floating point <g>
        So, I completely rewrote the sqrt algorithm. It's still 3-11
        times slower than the FPU, but is it possible to beat hardware
        fsqrt that has a 14-bit lookup table? (athlon)
v0.18   Fixed type problem in ftoufpxpx causing false integer overflow
        compiler warnings.
v0.17   Added a wrapper around ln() so constants can be passed. If a
        variable is passed, it's no longer changed itself!
v0.16   Replaced divs by muls in ln()
v0.15   Added ln()
v0.14   Removed silly 16p8 and 8p16 types
v0.13   Added exp()
v0.12   Changed sqrt() from nested macros to use a temp var (gcc trouble)
v0.11   Added sqrt()
v0.10   Basic types, mul() and div()
