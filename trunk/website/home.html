New release (0.31-beta) which includes all that was added to CVS in 2006.
Migrated the repo to Subversion before starting a major rewrite.

Two weeks passed. Here's a short update. I have setup a documentation
build system and after that I started working on the documentation itself.
You can view the first draft under
<A HREF="documentation.html">documentation</A>.
The XML source and the build system are in CVS and can be checked out if you
want to. After the documentation is finished, I will check the current
source code in. Yes, I changed the order. I feel more comfortable with that.
Things are going a bit slower than expected, but eventually all will
be up here :)

Started hosting at BerliOS today. I wasted way too much time on putting these
HTML pages together, fiddling with iframes and CSS, but in the end I chose
this simple layout which should render in about every browser around. Tested
with Opera, Konqueror, Mozilla, Galeon and IE6. So, now that the
framework is done, I only have to fill in the pages :) This coming week I will
try to finish my code and put it up on CVS. Next, I'll start working on the
documentation. First, let's get this website into CVS in a decent way.
